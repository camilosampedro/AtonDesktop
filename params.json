{"name":"Aton","tagline":"Free computer laboratory administrator.","body":"# Aton\r\nAton is a computer laboratory administrator built in Java. It allows a single computer to administrate a set of other computers in a laboratory using a simple Java application.\r\n## Available functions\r\n### Send messages from the administrator computer to any of the computers in the laboratory\r\nIf the laboratory administrator wants to send a message to a single computer (Or a subset of computers), Aton can handle it. It uses [Zenity](https://help.gnome.org/users/zenity/stable/index.html.es \"Manual de Zenity\") program for Linux.\r\n### Shutdown and turn on computers\r\nYou don't need to turn on or shutdown computer by computer. It is a waste of time! Aton can select all the computers (Or a subset of computers) to turn on or shut down using the commands [shutdown](http://hablemostux.blogspot.com/2011/09/apagado-automatico-en-linux-sudo.html \"Shutdown tutorial\") and [wakeonlan](http://hipertextual.com/archivo/2010/05/comando-linux-wakeonlan-enciende-tus-equipos-de-manera-remota/ \"Wake on lan tutorial\").\r\n\r\nThe LIS (Laboratorio Integrado de Sistemas) actually has a need of implementing an unified computer and user administration service.\r\n## Before downloading:\r\n1.
